# Data, python examples and reports for wider analysis
This repository contains financial market data, code (mainly **python**) and sample mini-projects that showcase a range of **visualisation** techniques for conveying insight and sparking wider debate and research.  

Sample projects shared include:-
#### Sample 1: The COVID crisis
Using data and visualisations to explore interconnections between deaths caused by the virus and a variety of predictor variables
###### Key techniques showcased:-
##### Time-series analysis, Markowitz mean-variance analysis, correlation heatmaps, feature selection, linear regression, residual boxplots, residual histograms, 
*Source data: Our World in Data, Daily Seated Diner Data ('State of the Industry', OpenTable), Index Valuations (Bloomberg)*  
#### Sample 2: The value anomaly revisited  

Taking a multi-country approach, this mini report seeks to answer whether lower starting point equity valuations, using EV/Sales and P/E multiples, have had signal power for higher future returns. The importance of the tech sector and growth in ESG investing assets are briefly investigated as alternative explanatory variables of returns  
###### Key techniques showcased:-
##### Visualisation /charting in **python**, using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, correlation heatmaps, scatter plots and histograms  

*Source data: Market prices (Bloomberg)*

#### Sample 3: Visualisaton - the contrast between the human & computer in the loop  

Using Vega-Lite code to digitise a human design to visually explore the relationship between central bank policy (Balance Sheet size) and stock market valuatins in the post Financial Crisis period.
