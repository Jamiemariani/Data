## Portfolio samples
# Data, python examples and reports for wider analysis
This repository contains financial market data, code (mainly **python**) and sample mini-projects that showcase a range of **visualisation**, **data science** and **machine learning** techniques for conveying insight and sparking wider debate and research.  

Sample projects shared include:-  

#### Sample 1: The COVID crisis
Using data and visualisations to explore interconnections between deaths caused by the virus and a variety of predictor variables
###### Key techniques showcased:-
##### In python code time-series analysis, Markowitz mean-variance, correlation heatmaps, feature selection, linear regression, residual boxplots & histograms 
*Source data: Our World in Data, Daily Seated Diner Data ('State of the Industry', OpenTable), Index Valuations (Bloomberg)*  

#### Sample 2: Machine Learning (ML) healthcare project

This mini study critically evaluates different pattern recognition machine learning algorithms. It performs supervised learning on symptoms of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms. 

###### Key techniques showcased:-
#####  In **python**, feature selection (correlation analysis), testing and training data samples, grid search to optimize hyper parametres, **5-fold stratified cross-validation**, SVMs (a non-perceptron based machine learning classification), a Sigmoid output function, Binary Cross Entropy, **confusion matrix**, Receiver Operation Curve (to review accuracy between training and test samples).  
*Source data: UCI machine learning repository (Zarrin 2020). The data is from a clinical study looking into COPD diagnosis.

#### Sample 3: The value anomaly revisited  

Taking a multi-country approach, this mini report seeks to answer whether lower starting point equity valuations, using EV/Sales and P/E multiples, have had signal power for higher future returns post the GFC (2009). The importance of the tech sector and growth in ESG investing assets are briefly investigated as alternative explanatory variables of returns  
###### Key techniques showcased:-
##### Visualisation /charting in **python**, using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, correlation heatmaps, scatter plots & histograms  

*Source data: Market prices (Bloomberg)*

#### Sample 4: Visualisaton - the contrast between the human & computer in the loop  

Using Vega-Lite code to digitise a human design to visually explore the relationship between central bank policy (Balance Sheet size) and stock market valuatins in the post Financial Crisis period.
